In web design, 3D design means adding shadows and detail to elements like interactive scrolling, dynamic text, and graphics to add depth to a flat screen. Many websites use 3D website designs to draw usersâ€™ attention to an image, text, or other detail. This can emphasize a CTA or make vital information more prominent.
